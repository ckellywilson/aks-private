# Bootstrap Script Enhancement and Security

## Context
Improving and securing the Terraform backend bootstrap script that creates Azure storage accounts, managed identities, and initial infrastructure for state management.

## Task
Enhance the bootstrap script with better security, error handling, VNet integration options, and improved automation capabilities.

## Current Bootstrap Script Features
- Creates storage account with security features enabled
- Sets up managed identity for Terraform operations
- Configures RBAC permissions for storage access
- Generates backend configuration files
- Supports multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Optional GitHub Actions service principal configuration

## Enhancement Areas

### 1. Security Improvements
- Enable private endpoints for storage account
- Configure network access rules and VNet integration
- Implement least-privilege access principles
- Add encryption key management options
- Enable audit logging and monitoring

### 2. Network Integration
- Create dedicated VNet for backend operations
- Configure service endpoints for Azure Storage
- Set up network security groups with appropriate rules
- Implement private DNS zones for private endpoints

### 3. Error Handling and Validation
- Better prerequisite checking and validation
- Improved error messages and troubleshooting hints
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Resource existence validation before creation

### 4. Automation and CI/CD Integration
- Support for automated deployment pipelines
- Configuration file generation for different tools
- Integration with Azure Key Vault for secrets
- Support for Infrastructure-as-Code workflows

## Script Enhancement Requirements
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enhanced bootstrap script features:

# Prerequisites validation
check_prerequisites() {
    # Azure CLI version check
    # Required permissions validation
    # Network connectivity tests
    # Resource naming validation
}

# Network setup
setup_backend_network() {
    # Create VNet for backend operations
    # Configure service endpoints
    # Set up network security groups
    # Configure private DNS zones
}

# Security configuration
configure_security() {
    # Enable private endpoints
    # Configure network access rules
    # Set up Key Vault integration
    # Enable audit logging
}

# Validation and testing
validate_setup() {
    # Test storage account access
    # Validate network connectivity
    # Check managed identity permissions
    # Verify Terraform backend functionality
}
```

## Configuration Options
- **Network Mode**: Public, Service Endpoints, Private Endpoints
- **Security Level**: Basic, Enhanced, Zero Trust
- **Environment Type**: Development, Production, Hybrid
- **Access Pattern**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Self-hosted

## Expected Enhancements
- VNet integration configuration options
- Private endpoint setup automation
- Enhanced security controls and compliance
- Better error handling and recovery
- Automated testing and validation
- Documentation generation and updates
- Configuration backup and restore

## Sample Enhanced Configuration
```bash
# Network configuration
ENABLE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=true
VNET_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.250.0.0/16"
BACKEND_SUBNET_CIDR="10.250.1.0/24"

# Security configuration
ENABLE_SOFT_DELETE=true
RETENTION_DAYS=90
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
KEY_VAULT_INTEGRATION=true

# Access configuration
ALLOWED_LOCATIONS=("GitHub Actions" "Azure DevOps" "Self-hosted")
ENABLE_VNET_ACCESS=true
ENABLE_IP_RESTRICTIONS=false
```

## Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests with real Azure resources
- Security compliance validation
- Performance and reliability testing
- Documentation accuracy verification

## Additional Context
- Integration with existing Terraform modules
- Support for multiple Azure subscriptions
- Compliance with organizational security policies
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems
- Support for disaster recovery scenarios
