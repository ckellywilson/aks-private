# Azure Security Best Practices Implementation

## Context
Implementing comprehensive security best practices for a private AKS cluster environment, including network security, identity management, compliance controls, and monitoring.

## Task
Design and implement security controls across all components of the private AKS infrastructure following Azure security best practices and compliance frameworks.

## Security Domains

### 1. Network Security
- Private networking with no public endpoints
- Network segmentation with subnets and NSGs
- Service endpoints and private endpoints
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for ingress
- DDoS protection and network monitoring

### 2. Identity and Access Management
- Azure AD integration for cluster access
- Managed identities for service authentication
- RBAC with least-privilege access
- Pod identity for application authentication
- Service principal lifecycle management

### 3. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Certificate management and rotation
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Data classification and handling

### 4. Compliance and Governance
- Azure Policy for governance controls
- Resource tagging and cost management
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance scanning and reporting
- Security baselines and benchmarks

## Implementation Areas

### Storage Account Security
```bash
# Security features for Terraform backend storage
--allow-blob-public-access false
--allow-shared-key-access false
--https-only true
--min-tls-version TLS1_2
--default-action Deny
--bypass AzureServices
```

### AKS Cluster Security
```hcl
# AKS security configuration
private_cluster_enabled = true
enable_pod_security_policy = true
enable_rbac = true
network_policy = "azure"
azure_policy_enabled = true

# Node pool security
os_disk_type = "Ephemeral"
enable_encryption_at_host = true
```

### Container Security
- Base image security scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Admission controllers and policies
- Secret injection and management
- Network policies for pod communication

## Security Controls Checklist

### ✅ Network Controls
- [ ] Private cluster with no public API endpoint
- [ ] VNet integration with custom address space
- [ ] Network security groups with minimal required rules
- [ ] Service endpoints for Azure services
- [ ] Private endpoints for sensitive services
- [ ] Network policies for pod-to-pod communication

### ✅ Identity Controls
- [ ] Managed identities for all service authentication
- [ ] Azure AD integration for user access
- [ ] RBAC with role-based permissions
- [ ] Pod identity for application authentication
- [ ] Regular access review and cleanup

### ✅ Data Controls
- [ ] Encryption at rest for all storage
- [ ] TLS encryption for all communications
- [ ] Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Certificate automation and rotation
- [ ] Backup and retention policies

### ✅ Monitoring Controls
- [ ] Azure Monitor and Log Analytics integration
- [ ] Security event logging and alerting
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Cost monitoring and budgets
- [ ] Compliance scanning and reporting

## Security Scanning and Validation
```bash
# Infrastructure security scanning
checkov -f main.tf --framework terraform

# Container image scanning
az acr task create --name security-scan --registry myregistry --image ubuntu:latest

# Kubernetes security scanning
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/main/job.yaml

# Runtime security monitoring
kubectl apply -f falco-daemonset.yaml
```

## Incident Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Monitoring and alerting systems
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and containment
3. **Response**: Mitigation and remediation steps
4. **Recovery**: Service restoration and validation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Documentation and improvements

## Compliance Frameworks
- **Azure Security Benchmark**: Microsoft's security recommendations
- **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**: Industry standard security configuration
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security framework
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive security architecture documentation
- Automated security scanning and validation
- Incident response procedures and playbooks
- Compliance reporting and attestation
- Security training and awareness materials
- Regular security assessments and improvements

## Additional Context
- Integration with organizational security policies
- Compliance with industry regulations
- Cost optimization while maintaining security
- Performance impact assessment of security controls
- Integration with existing security tools and processes
