- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform modules for consistent environment provisioning
- **GitOps workflows** with ArgoCD or Flux for application deployment automation
- **Security scanning** integration in CI/CD pipeline (container images, infrastructure code, secrets)
- **Blue-green deployments** and canary releases for zero-downtime application updates

### Cost Optimization & Governance
- **Azure Policy** for governance, compliance, and cost control automation
- **Cluster autoscaler** and **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for dynamic resource optimization
- **Spot instances** for non-critical workloads and significant cost savings
- **Resource quotas** and **limit ranges** for workload resource management
