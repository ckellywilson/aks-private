# Security Architecture - Zero Trust Implementation

## Eraser.io Prompt

**Context**: Generate a comprehensive security architecture diagram for AKS private clusters implementing zero-trust security principles, showing defense-in-depth strategies, identity and access management, network security, and compliance controls.

## Architecture Overview

Create a detailed security architecture diagram showcasing a zero-trust security model for AKS private clusters with:

### Zero Trust Security Principles
